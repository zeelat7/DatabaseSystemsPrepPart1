
NOTES: 

- In the examples of SQL statments below I used my netid ajb254, and you need to change that to your NETID

- If you want to RERUN the create view commands you will get the error message that view is already created. Here is an example fo the error message:

xyz=> CREATE TEMP VIEW ajb254rightview AS SELECT * FROM pilot.mail;
ERROR:  relation "ajb254rightview" already exists


- So you need to clean up before you create the view again, and you clean up by dropping the temp view

xyz=> drop view ajb254leftview;
DROP VIEW
xyz=> drop view ajb254rightview;
DROP VIEW
xyz=> drop view ajb254join;

Step 1: Connect dornick



Step 2: Connect to postgree database server:

psql -h 129.105.208.226 -U ajb254 -d postgres



Step 3: Connect databse instance
\c xyz



Step 4: Get the attributes/columns/rows from CUSTOMER table in a VIEW

CREATE TEMP VIEW ajb254leftview AS SELECT acctno AS customerid, ltd_sales, ltd_transactions, ytd_sales_2009, ytd_transactions_2009 FROM pilot.customer;



Step 5: (Sanity Test - do you see records in your view/table?)

select * from zml3464leftview limit 20;



Step 6:  Get the attributes/columns/rows from MAIL table in a VIEW

CREATE TEMP VIEW zml3464rightview AS SELECT * FROM pilot.mail;



Step 7: (Sanity Test - do you see records in your view/table?)

select * from zml3464rightview limit 20;



Step 8: (Do a LEFT OUTER JOIN)
CREATE TEMP VIEW zml3464join AS SELECT * FROM zml3464leftview LEFT OUTER JOIN zml3464rightview ON customerid = acctno;



Step 9: (Sanity Test - do you see records in your view/table?)

select * from zml3464join limit 20;



Step 10: (What are the attributes in your view/table?)

 \d zml3464join



Step 11: (Create CSV file)

\copy (SELECT * FROM zml3464join LIMIT 100) TO â€˜zml3464join.csv' WITH DELIMITER ',' NULL AS '\null' CSV HEADER
